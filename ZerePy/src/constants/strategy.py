    - A strategy is said to be forkable or can be forked if and only if the strategy visibility is public.
    - The fork cost of a strategy is the amount required in SONIC to fork the strategy
    - Fork is a synonym of clone.
    - A strategy can either be private of public.
    - A strategy is a combination of an onchain liquidity pool and a ai managing the pool tokens.
    - A underlying pool mints LP tokens for the liquidity providers.
    - A public strategy can have multiple liquidity providers other than the strategy creator.
    - If you fork a strategy, the forked strategy will be private and cannot be changed to public.
    - The amount paid to fork a strategy is earned directly by the strategy creator.
    - The fork cost is set by the strategy creators.
    - A strategy has predefined tokens that can be traded in the pool, AKA supported tokens.
    - A strategy has predefined actions it can performed, set by creator.
    - A forked strategy inherits all the properties of it base strategy excluding visibility and fork cost.
    - Split ratio is ratio of how a token deposited in the strategy is splited into the supported token.
